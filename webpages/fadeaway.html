					<h4 class="caption">
						The forearm was slightly bent towards his shooting eye. The release was dominated by his index finger to avoid shooting sideways. Years of toil meant the middle knuckle on that critical finger was later debilitated by arthritis.
					</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="card">
					<img src="../assets/training/anatomy2.png" class="hip">
					<h4 class="caption">
						The elbow, shoulder and hip would all be in line with the basket, ensuring the ball flies straight towards the basket. If he was in a tight position with his shooting side away from the basket, he would whip his leg around to force his hips and shoulder to rotate.
					</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="card">
					<img src="../assets/training/anatomy3.png" class="foot">
					<h4 class="caption">
						The alignment was created by his feet, usually turned towards his non-shooting side. The wide base and knees pointing inwards helped get him altitude. Knee surgeries, however, forced him to alter his shot form.
